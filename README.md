![dataDM](datadm-header.png?raw=true)

DataDM is your private data assistant. A conversational interface for your data where you can load, clean, transform, and visualize without a single line of code. DataDM is open source and can be run entirely locally, keeping your juicy data secrets fully private. Slide into your data's DMs tonight.

## Demo

https://github.com/approximatelabs/datadm/assets/916073/f15e6ab5-8108-40ea-a6de-c69a1389af84

Note: Demo above is `GPT-4`, which sends the conversation to OpenAI's API. To use in full local mode, be sure to select `starchat-alpha-cuda` or `starchat-beta-cuda` as the model. This will use the StarChat model, which is a bit less capable but runs entirely locally.

‚ö†Ô∏è LLMs are known to hallucinate and generate fake results. So, double-check before trusting their results blindly!

## Features
- [x] Persistent Juptyer kernel backend for data manipulation during conversation
- [x] Run entirely locally, keeping your data private
- [x] Natural language chat, visualizations/plots, and direct download of data assets
- [x] Easy to use docker-images for one-line deployment
- [x] Load multiple tables directly into the chat
- [x] Option to use OpenAI's GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 (requires API key)
- [ ] WIP: GGML based mode (CPU only, no GPU required)
- [ ] WIP: Rollback kernel state when undo using `criu`
- [ ] TODO: Support for more data sources (e.g. SQL, S3, PySpark etc.)
- [ ] TODO: Export a conversation as a notebook or html

## Things you can ask DataDM
- [x] Load data from a URL
- [x] Clean data by removing duplicates, nulls, outliers, etc.
- [x] Join data from multiple tables into a single output table
- [x] Visualize data with plots and charts
- [x] Ask whatever you want to your very own private code-interpreter

## Quickstart

You can use docker, colab, or install locally.

### 1. Docker to run locally
```bash
docker run -e OPENAI_API_KEY={{YOUR_API_KEY_HERE}} -p 7860:7860 -it ghcr.io/approximatelabs/datadm:latest
```

For local-mode using StarChat model (requiring a CUDA device with at least 24GB of RAM)
```bash
docker run --gpus all -p 7860:7860 -it ghcr.io/approximatelabs/datadm:0.2.1-cuda
```

### 2. Colab to run in the cloud

### 3. Use as a python package

> ‚ö†Ô∏è datadm used this way runs LLM generated code in your userspace

For local-data, cloud-model mode (no GPU required) - requires an OpenAI API key
```bash
$ pip install datadm
$ datadm
```

For local-mode using StarChat model (requiring a CUDA device with at least 24GB of RAM)
```bash
$ pip install "datadm[cuda]"
$ datadm
```
